Basically the way it works is that there are 2 pieces of equipment that are in the water, one being the temperature sensor and the other the pH sensor. They stay in the water collecting data every minute. The data goes to a spreadsheet that analyses the data. This basically sums it up; the main idea was that it would help the aquaponics lab in knowing their water better and we get the data.

Building our project was kind of complicated but simpler than it seemed. Connecting the wires was the main focus for which we used jumper wires to connect the pH sensor to the breadboard - which was the main issue.
